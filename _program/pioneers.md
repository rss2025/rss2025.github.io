RSS Pioneers is an intensive workshop for senior Ph.D. students and early career researchers in the robotics community. Held in conjunction with the main Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, each year the RSS Pioneers brings together a cohort of the worldâ€™s top early-career researchers. The workshop aims to provide these promising researchers with networking opportunities and help to navigate their next career stages, and foster creativity and collaboration surrounding challenges in all areas of robotics. The workshop will include a mix of research and career talks from senior scholars in the field from both academia and industry, research presentations from attendees and networking activities. RSS Pioneers is planned to be an in-person workshop, excluding any unexpected developments. This is the seventh RSS Pioneers workshop and is planned to be held in **Delft, Netherlands on July 14th**.
