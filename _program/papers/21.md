<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Off-road autonomy, crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, agriculture, and planetary exploration, poses unique problems due to challenging terrains, as well as due to the risk involved in testing or deploying such systems. 
 Accessible platforms have the potential to widen the field to a broader set of researchers and students.
 Existing efforts in making on-road autonomy more accessible have seen success, yet aggressive off-road autonomy remains underserved.
 We seek to fill this gap by introducing HOUND, a 1/10th-scale, inexpensive, off-road autonomous car platform that can handle challenging outdoor terrains at high speeds.
 To aid development speed, we integrate HOUND with BeamNG, a state-of-the-art driving simulator to enable both software in the loop as well as hardware in the loop testing.
 To reduce the extent of ruggedization required, and thus cost, we integrate a rollover prevention system as a safety feature into the platform.
 Real-world trials over 50 kilometers demonstrate the platform's longevity and effectiveness over varied terrains and speeds.
