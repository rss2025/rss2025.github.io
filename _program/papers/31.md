<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Robot-assisted feeding holds immense promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with mobility limitations who are unable to feed themselves independently. However, there exists a large gap between the kinds of homogeneous, curated plates existing assistive feeding systems can handle, and truly in-the-wild meals. Feeding realistic plates is immensely challenging due to the sheer range of food items that a robot may encounter, each requiring specialized manipulation strategies which must be sequenced over a long-horizon to feed an entire meal. An assistive feeding system should not only be able to sequence different strategies efficiently in order to feed an entire meal, but also in a way that is mindful of user preferences given the personalized nature of the task. We address this with FLAIR, a system for long-horizon feeding which leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of foundation models, along with a library of parameterized skills, to plan and execute user-preferred and efficient bite sequences. In real-world evaluations across 6 highly realistic plates, we find that FLAIR can effectively tap into a library of dexterous skills for efficient plate clearance, while adhering to the diverse preferences of over 42 as evaluated in a user study. We finally demonstrate the real-world efficacy of our approach by deploying our system with an in-mouth bite transfer framework for successfully feeding a care recipient with mobility limitations.
