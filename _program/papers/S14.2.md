<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Replicating human-like dexterity in robotic hands has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Recently, with the rise of robot learning and humanoids, the demand for dexterous robot hands to be reliable, affordable, and easy to reproduce has grown significantly. To address these needs, we present LEAP Hand V3, a $200 8-DOF highly dexterous robotic hand designed for robot learning research. It is strong yet compliant, using a hybrid rigid-soft structure that is very durable. Its universal dexterous MCP joint provides exceptional finger mobility, enabling a variety of different grasps. The parts are all 3D printed and can be assembled very easily in under two hours using our instructions. Importantly, we offer a suite of advanced open-source software tools to support robot learning research.  This includes human video retargeting code from MANO and Vision Pro, motion capture teleoperation code using the Manus Glove, and a URDF with sim2real examples for various simulation engines.  We will showcase LEAP Hand V3—designed specifically for this demonstration—alongside our previous robot hands with real robot interactive demos. Following our successful demos at RSS 2023 and 2024, we will again offer an engaging opportunity for attendees to get hands-on experience and information about the accessibility of low-cost, open-source robotic hands.
