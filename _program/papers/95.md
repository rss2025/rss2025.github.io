<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Communication is fundamental for multi-robot collaboration, with accurate radio mapping playing a crucial role in predicting signal strength between robots. However, modeling radio signal propagation in large and occluded environments is challenging due to complex interactions between signals and obstacles. Existing methods face two key limitations: they struggle to predict signal strength for transmitter-receiver pairs not present in the training set, while also requiring extensive manual data collection for modeling, making them impractical for large, obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose FERMI, a flexible radio mapping framework. FERMI combines physics-based modeling of direct signal paths with a neural network to capture environmental interactions with radio signals. This hybrid model learns radio signal propagation more efficiently, requiring only sparse training data. Additionally, FERMI introduces a scalable planning method for autonomous data collection using a multi-robot team. By increasing parallelism in data collection and minimizing robot travel costs between regions, overall data collection efficiency is significantly improved. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios demonstrate that FERMI enables accurate signal prediction and generalizes well to unseen positions in complex environments. It also supports fully autonomous data collection and scales to different team sizes, offering a flexible solution for creating radio maps.
