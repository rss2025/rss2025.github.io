<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Ergodic coverage provides a robust framework for generating exploratory behaviors in embodied agents by aligning the spatial distribution of an agent's trajectory with a target distribution. However, solving this optimization problem is challenging due to the need to minimize the difference between distributions while respecting the agent's dynamic constraints. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to ergodic coverage through an unconstrained optimization paradigm based on flow matching, a technique widely used in variational inference and generative modeling for efficient and scalable sampling. We formally show that the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage is equivalent to a linear quadratic optimal control problem, enabling a closed-form solution. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that our method offers two key advantages: (1) it enables unconstrained optimization under the standard Fourier ergodic metric with comparable coverage performance and improved computational efficiency compared to existing trajectory optimization methods, and (2) it facilitates the use of alternative metrics to address the limitations of existing methods. Specifically, incorporating Stein variational gradient flow enables ergodic coverage over unnormalized distributions without compromising coverage performance or computational efficiency, and incorporating optimal transport-based flow significantly improves coverage performance for non-smooth distributions. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method through hardware demonstrations on a Franka Emika Panda robot.
