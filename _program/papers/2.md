<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Recent strides in model predictive control (MPC)
 underscore a dependence on numerical advancements to efficiently
 and accurately solve large-scale problems. Given the substantial
 number of variables characterizing typical whole-body optimal
 control problems —often numbering in the thousands— exploiting
 the sparse structure of the numerical problem becomes crucial
 to meet computational demands, typically in the range of a
 few milliseconds. A fundamental building block for computing
 Newton or Sequential Quadratic Programming steps in direct
 optimal control methods involves addressing the linear-quadratic
 regulator (LQR) problem. This paper concentrates on equality-
 constrained problems featuring implicit system dynamics and
 dual regularization, a characteristic found in advanced interior-
 point or augmented-Lagrangian solvers. Here, we introduce a
 parallel algorithm designed for solving an LQR problem with
 dual regularization. Leveraging a rewriting of the LQR recursion
 through block elimination, we first enhanced the efficiency of
 the serial algorithm, then subsequently generalized to handle
 parametric LQR. This extension enables us to split decision
 variables and to solve several subproblems concurrently. Our
 algorithm is implemented (and will be released in open source) in a
 nonlinear constrained implicit optimal control solver. It showcases
 improved performance over previous serial formulations and we
 validate its efficacy by deploying it in the model predictive control
 of a real quadruped robot.
