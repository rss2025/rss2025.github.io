<b style="color: black;">Abstract: </b>Building upon our previous contributions, this
 paper introduces Arena 3.0, an extension of Arena-Bench,
 Arena 1.0, and Arena 2.0 focusing on the development,
 simulation, and benchmarking of social navigation approaches
 in collaborative environments. We significantly enhance the re-
 alism of human behavior simulation by incorporating a diverse
 array of new social force models and interaction patterns,
 encompassing both human-human and human-robot dynam-
 ics. The platform provides a comprehensive set of new task
 modes, designed for extensive benchmarking and testing and is
 capable of generating realistic and human-centric environments
 dynamically, catering to a broad spectrum of social navigation
 scenarios. In addition, the platform’s functionalities have been
 abstracted across three widely used simulators, each tailored
 for specific training and testing purposes. The platform’s
 efficacy has been validated through an extensive benchmark
 and user evaluations of the platform by a global community of
 researchers and students, which noted the substantial improve-
 ment compared to previous versions and expressed interests to
 utilize the platform for future research and development. Arena
 3.0 is openly available at https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav.
