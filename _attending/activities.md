Heading to RSS? Join us the weekend before for the LeRobot Hackathon in LA! 🤖

Yondu AI is hosting the Los Angeles branch of the global LeRobot Hackathon at our warehouse in Gardena, 1 week before the RSS Conference kicks off. Whether you're deep into robot learning, love tinkering with hardware, or have a really cool project you’ve been wanting to build forever, build it here!

We will not just have SO-100s, but wheeled humanoid robots, bimanual mobile manipulators, tabletop bimanual arms, and more! You’ll get help from our team and a great opportunity to experiment and build any project you can dream up.
