Check [here](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/visa-the-netherlands/visa-required) to check if you are required to apply for a Visa to the Netherlands. If you are required to apply for a short stay Schengen visa for the Netherlands, you will find all the instructions [here](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/visa-the-netherlands/schengen-visa).

RSS attendees who are required to apply for a visa will need to fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YHgmYsHUIlVckCg3OFabpGBbPzEAwcpd8yvAO_fW8GU/viewform?ts=65c98f20&exids=71471483,71471477&edit_requested=true)  after they register at RSS and have received an RSS registration number. Organizers will reach out to you with a signed invitation letter, which you can use to support your Netherlands visa application.

Registered participants who are not be able to fly to the Netherlands for RSS 2024 due to unexpected circumstances that are not under their control, such as inability to acquire a visa or illness, can cancel their registration by July 1st and will be reimbursed for the full cost of their original registration. Alternatively, in this scenario, they can transfer the registration to another person at the same registration level (student/academic/industry). Participants who want to cancel or transfer their registration should communicate with the registration chair, Lucienne Dado ([rss2024@tudelft.nl](mailto:rss2024@tudelft.nl)) and Prof. Daniel Seita ([seita@usc.edu](mailto:seita@usc.edu)), and provide proof for the reason of their cancellation in their communication. After July 2nd, the conference will not be able to consider cancellation and refund the cost of registration.
