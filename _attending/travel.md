## Travel

The closest large international airport to the University of Southern California is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Some American cities also have flights to Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR), although the commutte is longer.


## Directions to the venue

The RSS2025 conference will take place at the University of Southern California (USC). The main conference sessions will be held at the Bovard Auditorium: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/gmsxcUqwNSfjsuHL8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gmsxcUqwNSfjsuHL8)

While Los Angeles has [a significant railway system](https://www.metro.net/riding/guide/system-maps/), the easiest way to get to the USC campus from any airport is still by using rideshare services. Uber, Lyft and Opoli operate in Los Angeles. In LAX, travelers must first take a free shuttle (green buses labeled LAX-it) to the ridesharing area to use these services.

[Metro line E](https://www.metro.net/riding/schedules-2/?line=804) connects Santa Monica to Downtown LA with three stops around USC. Specifically, "Expo Park / USC" is the closest metro station to the Bovard Auditorium. To use the metro (or any public transportation system in LA), travelers need to use a [TAP card](https://www.taptogo.net/TAPPurchase), which can be purchased at most metro stations via TAP vending machines or through [the official Tap App](https://www.taptogo.net/articles/en_US/Website_content/TAP-App).

For attendees who want to drive, daily and hourly parking options are available in and around the campus: [https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/](https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/)

## Accomodation

There is a variety of accommodation choices available around the venue. USC operates a hotel adjacent to the campus, which is a 10 minutes walk from the Bovard Auditorium: [USC Hotel](https://uschotel.usc.edu/). RSS 2025 attendees can use the code "Tommy" to book using the university's special rates.

In addition, the university provides special rates for several other hotels in/near Los Angeles. The full list can be found below.
