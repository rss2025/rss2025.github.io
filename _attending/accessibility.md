## Getting around Delft
Public transit is moderately accessible for wheelchair users.  Most buses should be accessible for wheelchair users but mobility scooters are not permitted.  Some but not all tram lines are accessible.  However, Delft is a small city (max 5km/3miles from corner to corner), extremely bike-friendly, and most street crossings have curb cuts, so mobility device users may find it easiest to navigate the streets directly rather than using transit.
