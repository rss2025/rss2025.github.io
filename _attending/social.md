# Welcome Reception
## Monday July 15th,  6:00 pm – 7:30 pm

The Hortus Botanicus (Adres: Poortlandplein 6, Delft):

In the TU Delft technical botanic garden, botanical research has been done on plants for more than 100 years. It has brought many wild plants to industrial applications and has been an inspiration for breakthrough innovations. The garden is still the site of various research projects, but it is also a beautiful garden where you can relax, recharge and always discover new things.
